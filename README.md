To make sure my code, program, or software is functional and secure, I focus on strong unit testing and careful validation. I write tests for every main feature, making sure that things like creating, updating, and deleting data all work as expected. I also check edge cases, like testing long inputs or invalid data, to catch problems early. Staying disciplined with testing helps me catch bugs before they become bigger issues and keeps the program reliable.

When it comes to user needs, I carefully read through the requirements and make sure my code matches what users expect. I test not just the "normal" inputs but also what might happen if users make mistakes. This way, I build software that's more flexible and ready for real-world use. For designing software, I break everything into smaller pieces that are easier to test and manage. I also think like a tester, not just a developer, so I can find problems before users do.
